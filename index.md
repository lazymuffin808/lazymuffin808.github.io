# 🌐 distributed-system-algorithms - Easy Algorithms for Coordinated Computing

[![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-v1.0-brightgreen)](https://github.com/lazymuffin808/distributed-system-algorithms/releases)

## 📖 Overview

The **distributed-system-algorithms** project offers simple implementations of essential algorithms for distributed systems. These algorithms help multiple computers work together smoothly, even when they can't rely on a single clock or communicate instantly. This repository contains practical Go code to help users understand how these algorithms function.

## 📚 Understanding the Algorithms

This project covers several key algorithms within distributed systems, including:

- **Two-Phase Commitment:** Ensures all parts of a transaction either commit together or not at all.
- **Leader Election:** Decides which node acts as the coordinator in distributed tasks.
- **Consensus Algorithms:** Helps multiple nodes agree on shared data values.

Each algorithm comes with example scenarios, making it easier for users to grasp how it operates in real-world applications.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

If you experience issues, here are some common problems and solutions:

- **Application Won’t Open:** Ensure that your system meets the requirements above. Make sure the application file is not corrupted.
- **Slow Performance:** Close any unnecessary applications running in the background to free up system resources.
- **Error Messages:** Check the documentation available in the application for explanations of error messages and troubleshooting steps.
